# Stage 2 - Processing
This stage prepares the data for analysis. The user can select the required processing steps depending on the data and analysis objectives.

#### Input
Simultaneous neural activity recordings from spatially arranged (on a grid) electrodes/pixels

* A neo.Block object containing
an AnalogSignal with all signal channels (additional AnalogSignal objects are ignored) with
    * array_annotations: _'x_coords'_ and _'y_coords'_ specifying the integer position on the electrode/pixel grid of the channels
    * annotation: _'spatial_scale'_ specifying the distance between electrodes/pixels as quantities.Quantity object

#### Output
Activity signals, cleaned and pre-processed to user specifications

* Format and shape is identical to the input. AnalogSignal.description contains a summary of the preformed processing steps

## Usage
In this stage all blocks can be selected and arranged in arbitrary order. The execution order is specified by the config parameter `BLOCK_ORDER`.

Other as in other stages, in this stage, all blocks are re-executed with every snakemake call. Because, the execution order of the blocks is completely modular and might change in-between runs, rerunning all blocks with the latest execution order ensures that no intermediate file with a contradicting origination confounds the results.

## Blocks
